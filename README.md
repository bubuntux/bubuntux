- Flutter (Dart) for :iphone: + :computer_mouse:

## Pickiness

I'm picky because i want my development experience to be :sunny: and not :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain:

- :penguin: I want a Linux OS for my work computer, currently running Fedora Sericea. :no_good: No Windows or OSX
- :whale: I develop in containers (literally), that's why Linux is a must ([Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) FTW!)
- :heart: Java 17+, Spring, Bash, Containers, Linux, REST, NeoVim
- :seedling: I know a little and want to learn more about: Rust, Go, Dart, Flutter
- :anger: I know but don't want to use: C#, Python, Nodejs, Javascript, Scala, Jenkins

## Other
